# 9MD Framework Validator Skill

## Purpose
This skill validates Content Intelligence Matrix (CIM) allocations against the StarDance 9 Dimensions of Human Conversion (9MD) framework. It explains framework concepts, validates mathematical correctness, enforces dimension interactions, and provides strategic guidance on allocation design.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- ✓ Validate that allocations sum to exactly 100 and each dimension is 0-100
- ✓ Explain what each of the 9 dimensions means and how to score them
- ✓ Check for dimension interaction issues (synergies and tensions)
- ✓ Advise on context-appropriate allocation strategies
- ✓ Debug allocation problems and suggest solutions

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger these patterns** to activate the validator:

- "Validate this allocation: [numbers]"
- "Is this allocation valid?"
- "What does [dimension name] mean?"
- "Explain the 9MD framework"
- "Why can't I use these values?"
- "My allocation is invalid. Fix it."
- "Check for dimension tensions in this allocation"
- "What's a good allocation for [use case]?"
- "Are these dimensions in tension?"

---

## The 9 Dimensions of Human Conversion (9MD)

### Foundation Rules
- **Sum Rule**: All 9 dimensions must sum to exactly 100
- **Range Rule**: Each dimension must be 0-100 (inclusive)
- **Balance Rule**: Consider synergies and tensions when allocating

---

### Dimension 1: PRESENCE
**Definition**: The capacity to command immediate attention and create a sense of "being here now" that stops the scroll.

**Psychological Driver**: Breaks through cognitive load; signals salience and importance.

**Sub-Components**:
- Attention capture (pattern interrupts, unexpected elements)
- Sensory engagement (visual/auditory stimulation)
- Opening hook strength (first 2-3 seconds)
- Spatial dominance (how content fills the frame)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Bold visual contrast in opening frame
- Unexpected motion, sound, or color shift
- Direct eye contact or direct address ("You...")
- Question posed immediately (hook within 1 second)
- Dominant focal point, not background noise
- Fast-cut editing or rapid pacing

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Gradual fade-in or slow opening
- Generic stock footage opening
- Hook buried after 3+ seconds
- Passive, observational framing with no direct engagement
- Diffused visual focus
- No clear attention trigger

**Context Notes**:
- High Presence essential for: Short-form video (TikTok, Reels), impulse purchases, crowded feeds
- Lower Presence acceptable for: Long-form content, educational material, premium/luxury (where Taste dominates)

---

### Dimension 2: AUTHENTICITY
**Definition**: The perceived genuineness that signals real human experience over manufactured marketing.

**Psychological Driver**: Mimetic desire—humans want what real people want; manufactured desire feels false and triggers resistance.

**Sub-Components**:
- Genuine emotion (real vs. performed affect)
- Imperfection tolerance (visible grain, shaky cam, ambient noise)
- Behind-the-scenes elements (not just polished final product)
- Real vs. produced aesthetic (UGC vs. studio)
- Voice authenticity (conversational vs. scripted)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- UGC-style footage (handheld, natural lighting)
- Visible imperfections (shaky cam, audio inconsistencies)
- Unscripted moments, natural dialogue
- Real customer or founder presence (not actors)
- Ambient audio, not pristine sound design
- Raw emotion visible (slight hesitation, genuine reaction)

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Over-produced, glossy aesthetic
- Perfect lighting, staging, framing
- Obvious actor performances
- Corporate or professional voiceover
- Studio-produced audio and music
- Polished to the point of feeling sterile

**Context Notes**:
- Rising consumer expectation for authenticity across all categories
- Tension with Taste: Higher authenticity = lower polish; higher Taste = higher polish (requires balance)
- Synergy with Empathy: Real people + real problems = authentic understanding

---

### Dimension 3: TRUST
**Definition**: The cumulative signals that reduce perceived risk and establish credibility.

**Psychological Driver**: Uncertainty increases friction; visible proof reduces perceived risk and lowers purchase resistance.

**Sub-Components**:
- Social proof (reviews, testimonials, visible numbers)
- Authority signals (credentials, certifications, logos, "as seen in")
- Transparency (pricing, ingredients, process, sourcing)
- Risk reversal (guarantees, free trials, satisfaction promises)
- Consistency (brand alignment, repeated messaging)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Visible star ratings or review counts ("4.8 stars from 10k reviews")
- "As seen in" logos or media mentions
- Money-back guarantee prominently displayed
- Real customer testimonials with names, faces, results
- Specific numbers or metrics ("92% saw results in 30 days")
- Founder credentials or expert background
- Third-party certifications or awards

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- No social proof elements
- Vague claims without evidence ("customers love it")
- Hidden pricing or terms
- Anonymous testimonials ("A customer from California")
- Generic stock testimonials
- No credentials or authority signals
- No guarantees or risk reversal

**Context Notes**:
- Tension with Momentum: Providing proof takes time/space, urgency messaging can feel manipulative
- Synergy with Ethics: Trust + transparency about values = stronger credibility
- Critical for: New products, premium pricing, unknown brands, high-ticket items

---

### Dimension 4: EMPATHY
**Definition**: The demonstrated understanding of the viewer's situation, pain points, and aspirations.

**Psychological Driver**: People buy solutions to their problems, not products. Content that names the pain gets immediate resonance.

**Sub-Components**:
- Pain point articulation (naming the struggle explicitly)
- Emotional resonance (feeling understood, seen, acknowledged)
- Aspiration mirroring (desired future state visualized)
- Identity reflection (seeing oneself in the content)
- Journey acknowledgment (where they've been, how far they've come)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- "You know that feeling when..." (pain articulation)
- Before/after transformation explicitly shown
- Target audience visually represented (age, appearance, demographics match)
- Pain explicitly named and validated ("This sucks and I felt it too")
- Aspiration clearly shown (future state attractive and attainable)
- Overcoming obstacles acknowledged
- Vulnerability shown by creator/founder

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Product-first, feature-focused approach
- Generic "everyone" messaging with no specificity
- No acknowledgment of viewer's situation or struggle
- Seller-centric narrative ("we're so great")
- No visual representation of target audience
- Aspirational but unrelatable
- Focus on product benefits, not life benefits

**Context Notes**:
- Synergy with Authenticity: Real vulnerability + real understanding = powerful empathy
- Synergy with Momentum: Naming pain + showing solution + clear CTA = conversion sequence
- Essential for: DTC, wellness, lifestyle, self-improvement, problem-solution narratives

---

### Dimension 5: TASTE
**Definition**: The aesthetic sophistication level that signals alignment with the viewer's cultural positioning and aspirational identity.

**Psychological Driver**: Aesthetic signals class positioning and taste; misaligned taste suggests "not for people like me."

**Sub-Components**:
- Visual sophistication (composition, color theory, negative space)
- Cultural currency (awareness of current trends and references)
- Production value alignment (matches price point and brand positioning)
- Typography and design quality (font choice, hierarchy, spacing)
- Audio/music selection (curated, intentional, on-brand)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Intentional, curated color palette (not random or chaotic)
- On-trend visual references (current design language)
- Typography matches brand positioning (serif = classic; sans-serif = modern; script = luxury)
- Music selection feels curated and intentional
- Negative space used effectively
- Composition follows visual hierarchy
- Production value matches or exceeds price point

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Generic stock aesthetic
- Dated visual references (colors, effects, design)
- Mismatched production value (discount product with premium production or vice versa)
- Default/random music selection
- No clear visual hierarchy
- Cluttered composition
- Production value too low for price point

**Context Notes**:
- Tension with Authenticity: Raw/rough = lower taste; polished = higher taste
- Synergy with Resonance: On-trend aesthetics + platform-native format = strong resonance
- Premium/luxury positioning requires high Taste; volume/discount positioning can accept lower Taste

---

### Dimension 6: ETHICS
**Definition**: The alignment with viewer values around sustainability, social responsibility, and business practices.

**Psychological Driver**: Values-based positioning creates tribal alignment; misalignment triggers rejection.

**Sub-Components**:
- Sustainability signals (environmental practices, certifications, sourcing)
- Social responsibility (community impact, labor practices, inclusivity)
- Transparency about business model (not extractive or exploitative)
- Inclusivity in representation (diverse casting, accessible language)
- Mission-driven messaging (purpose beyond profit)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Visible sustainability certifications (Fair Trade, B Corp, carbon-neutral)
- Diverse representation across age, ethnicity, ability, body type
- Supply chain transparency ("made in our facility by paid craftspeople")
- Community or charitable impact mentioned
- Mission-driven messaging ("X% of profits to...")
- Inclusive language and accessibility features
- Labor practice transparency

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- No values messaging at all
- Homogeneous representation (all same age, appearance, background)
- Pure profit-driven framing ("Buy more, we make more")
- Greenwashing or vague claims ("eco-friendly" with no specifics)
- No community or social impact mentioned
- Extractive messaging (taking value from viewers)

**Context Notes**:
- Increasing importance especially for younger demographics (Gen Z, Millennials)
- Can be secondary for some categories (commodity products) or primary (ethical brands)
- Synergy with Trust: Transparent ethics + values alignment = deep trust

---

### Dimension 7: AUTONOMY
**Definition**: The respect for viewer agency and avoidance of manipulative pressure tactics.

**Psychological Driver**: Autonomy is a fundamental human need; perceived manipulation triggers reactance (resistance and rejection).

**Sub-Components**:
- Choice architecture (options, not ultimatums or false scarcity)
- Information sufficiency (enough data to decide confidently)
- Pressure absence (no artificial urgency or FOMO tactics)
- Exit respect (easy to leave, no dark patterns)
- Comparison enabling (vs. alternatives, not positioned as "only option")

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- "When you're ready..." language (respects timing)
- Multiple options presented clearly
- Educational approach (teaching, not just selling)
- Acknowledgment that alternatives exist ("different approaches work for different people")
- Easy exit (no email capture walls, clear unsubscribe)
- Transparent limitations ("this works best if...")
- Time to decide (no countdown timers)

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Countdown timers ("Only available for 3 hours!")
- False scarcity ("Only 3 left!")
- High-pressure language ("Don't miss out!")
- Email walls or friction before exit
- Positioned as "only solution" 
- No mention of alternatives
- Manipulation tactics (testimonials that seem fake, urgency that doesn't match reality)

**Context Notes**:
- Tension with Momentum: Respecting choice slows urgency; creating urgency can feel disrespectful
- Higher importance in B2B, education, high-ticket; lower importance in impulse/low-ticket
- Increasingly important: Consumer distrust of pressure tactics is growing

---

### Dimension 8: MOMENTUM
**Definition**: The propulsive energy that moves viewers toward action through pacing, urgency, and clarity.

**Psychological Driver**: Action bias—people prefer clarity and motion over ambiguity; clear next steps reduce friction.

**Sub-Components**:
- Pacing and rhythm (edit speed, music tempo, shot duration)
- Urgency creation (legitimate time sensitivity, not artificial)
- Action clarity (obvious next step, not ambiguous CTAs)
- Friction reduction (ease of completing the action)
- Progress indication (steps to completion visible)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Clear, specific CTA ("Buy now", "Join free trial", "Download")
- Legitimate urgency (real deadline, genuine scarcity)
- Fast-paced editing in final act (accelerating energy)
- One obvious next step (not competing CTAs)
- Music tempo accelerates toward end
- Progress toward goal clear ("3 steps to...")
- Frictionless next action (one click away)

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- No CTA or vague CTA ("Check it out sometime")
- Meandering pacing with no acceleration
- Multiple competing actions (sign up, buy, call, visit website)
- Friction-heavy process (form fields, verification, friction)
- No urgency signal (could always do this later)
- Slow editing throughout
- Unclear next step

**Context Notes**:
- Tension with Autonomy: High urgency can feel manipulative; respecting choice slows momentum
- Tension with Trust: Providing proof takes time; fast pacing has no proof space
- Essential for: DTC, conversions, impulse products, time-limited offers
- Lower importance for: Brand awareness, relationship building, educational content

---

### Dimension 9: RESONANCE
**Definition**: The cultural and contextual fit that makes content feel native to its environment and memorable.

**Psychological Driver**: Platform-native content feels "of here"; repurposed content feels like an ad. Shared cultural references create tribal belonging.

**Sub-Components**:
- Platform nativity (feels right for the channel, not repurposed)
- Cultural timing (relevant to current moment, memes, trends)
- Shareability (worth spreading, quotable, meme-able)
- Memorability (sticky elements, catchy hooks, distinctive voice)
- Community fit (speaks community language, uses in-group references)

**High Score Indicators (70-100)**:
- Platform-native format (TikTok videos not YouTube; LinkedIn posts not Instagram Stories)
- References current trends, moments, or memes
- Quotable or shareable moments ("I need this on a t-shirt")
- Distinctive voice or aesthetic (recognizable even without branding)
- Community-specific language ("industry terms we use")
- Unexpected element that surprises and delights
- Highly memeable or remixable

**Low Score Indicators (0-30)**:
- Repurposed from other channels (YouTube video posted to TikTok)
- Dated references (trends from 2 years ago)
- Generic, forgettable content
- No distinctive voice or aesthetic
- Outsider perspective (doesn't understand community)
- Serious tone where platform expects humor
- No memorable element

**Context Notes**:
- Synergy with Authenticity: Authentic insider perspective + platform native = high resonance
- Synergy with Taste: On-trend aesthetics + platform-native format = strong resonance
- Critical for: Social media, viral growth, community building, brand loyalty
- Platform matters significantly: TikTok/Reels favor trend-aware; LinkedIn favors thought leadership; YouTube favors depth

## Dimension Interaction Matrix

### Synergies (Reinforce Each Other)
These dimensions work together—increasing both amplifies effect:

| Synergy | Why It Works | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Authenticity + Empathy** | Real vulnerability + genuine understanding = power | Founder shares exact pain they solved |
| **Trust + Ethics** | Transparent values + credible proof = deep trust | Certified sustainable + customer reviews |
| **Empathy + Momentum** | Naming pain + clear solution = conversion | "Here's what worked for me" + CTA |
| **Taste + Resonance** | On-trend aesthetics + platform native = magnetism | Curated TikTok that feels culturally native |

### Tensions (Require Careful Balance)
These dimensions work against each other—increasing one decreases the other:

| Tension | The Problem | Solution |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Authenticity ↔ Taste** | Raw/rough = low taste; polished = low authenticity | Find middle ground: Authentic but intentional |
| **Trust ↔ Momentum** | Proof takes time/space; urgency says "act now" | Use high-impact proof (testimonial not case study) |
| **Presence ↔ Autonomy** | Demanding attention = disrespectful; respecting choice = quiet | Lead with respect: "If this interests you..." |

---

## Validation Rules

### Rule 1: Mathematical Validity
\`\`\`
Sum of all 9 dimensions must equal exactly 100
Each dimension must be 0-100 (inclusive)

✓ Valid: 15, 10, 18, 12, 8, 5, 7, 20, 5 = 100
✗ Invalid: 15, 10, 18, 12, 8, 5, 7, 20, 6 = 101
✗ Invalid: 15, 10, 18, 12, 8, 5, 7, 20, -5 = 95 (negative value)
\`\`\`

### Rule 2: Dimension Interaction Validation
When allocating, consider:
- Are there unaddressed tensions?
- Are synergies being leveraged?
- Is the allocation balanced or lopsided?

**Red Flags**:
- High Presence + High Autonomy (demanding vs. respecting)
- High Authenticity + High Taste (raw vs. polished)
- High Trust + High Momentum (proof vs. urgency)

**Green Lights**:
- High Empathy + High Momentum (pain + solution)
- High Trust + High Ethics (credibility + values)

### Rule 3: Context-Appropriateness
Allocation should match campaign objective:

| Objective | Top Dimensions | Why |
|-----------|---|---|
| **DTC Conversion** | Momentum (20), Trust (18), Presence (15) | Need urgency, credibility, attention |
| **Brand Awareness** | Resonance (20), Taste (18), Presence (15) | Need memorability, aesthetic, salience |
| **UGC/Social Proof** | Authenticity (25), Empathy (20), Resonance (15) | Need realness, understanding, shareability |
| **Premium/Luxury** | Taste (25), Trust (15), Ethics (15) | Need aesthetic sophistication and values |
| **Urgency/Flash Sale** | Momentum (25), Presence (20), Trust (15) | Need drive to action, attention, credibility |

---

## How to Use This Skill

### Usage Pattern 1: Validate an Allocation
**You ask**: "Validate this allocation: presence: 15, authenticity: 10, trust: 18, empathy: 12, taste: 8, ethics: 5, autonomy: 7, momentum: 20, resonance: 5"

**I will**:
1. Check mathematical validity (sum = 100? each 0-100?)
2. Identify dimension interactions (tensions? synergies?)
3. Assess context-appropriateness
4. Provide pass/fail judgment
5. Suggest fixes if invalid

---

### Usage Pattern 2: Explain a Dimension
**You ask**: "What does Presence mean? How do I score it?"

**I will**:
1. Define the dimension
2. Explain the psychological driver
3. List sub-components
4. Provide high/low score examples
5. Suggest context where it matters most

---

### Usage Pattern 3: Fix an Invalid Allocation
**You ask**: "My allocation is invalid. Here's what I'm trying to do: [goal]. Fix it."

**I will**:
1. Understand your goal/context
2. Identify what's wrong
3. Suggest which dimensions to increase/decrease
4. Provide reasoning
5. Show corrected allocation

---

### Usage Pattern 4: Check Dimension Interactions
**You ask**: "Are these dimensions in tension? presence: 20, autonomy: 15"

**I will**:
1. Identify the tension (Presence demands attention, Autonomy respects choice)
2. Explain the conflict
3. Suggest balance strategies
4. Provide examples

---

## Key Principles

1. **Sum = 100 Always**: Non-negotiable mathematical rule
2. **Context Matters**: DTC ≠ Brand Awareness; allocations differ
3. **Tensions are Real**: Can't max out conflicting dimensions
4. **Synergies Are Powerful**: Lean into them when possible
5. **Allocation Reflects Strategy**: The numbers tell a story about what matters
6. **Validation is Objective**: Math is math; framework is framework

---

## Examples

### Example 1: DTC Flash Sale
**Goal**: Drive immediate conversions for 24-hour sale

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Presence: 20 (stop the scroll, it's happening NOW)
- Authenticity: 8 (less important for flash sales)
- Trust: 15 (quick credibility signal)
- Empathy: 10 (secondary for impulse buys)
- Taste: 5 (budget product, low taste acceptable)
- Ethics: 3 (not primary decision driver)
- Autonomy: 5 (high-pressure, limited choice acceptable)
- Momentum: 30 (drive to action, urgency)
- Resonance: 4 (speed over shareability)

**Validation**: Sum = 100 ✓
**Tensions**: Autonomy (5) + Momentum (30) = acceptable (high momentum justified by legitimate urgency)
**Assessment**: ✓ Valid for DTC flash sale

---

### Example 2: Premium/Luxury Brand
**Goal**: Establish brand as high-end, aspirational, values-aligned

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Presence: 8 (subtlety > attention-grabbing)
- Authenticity: 15 (founder story, real heritage)
- Trust: 15 (credentials, heritage, exclusivity)
- Empathy: 10 (understanding affluent audience)
- Taste: 25 (aesthetic is everything for luxury)
- Ethics: 18 (sustainability, values matter to luxury buyers)
- Autonomy: 5 (limited availability creates prestige)
- Momentum: 2 (no urgency; take your time deciding)
- Resonance: 7 (exclusive, not broadly trendy)

**Validation**: Sum = 100 ✓
**Tensions**: Low Presence acceptable (luxury doesn't shout); Low Momentum acceptable (premium positioning)
**Assessment**: ✓ Valid for luxury positioning

---

### Example 3: Social/Viral Content
**Goal**: Maximum shareability and organic reach

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Presence: 18 (must stop scroll)
- Authenticity: 20 (people share real moments)
- Trust: 5 (less important for viral)
- Empathy: 15 (relatable = shareable)
- Taste: 8 (trend-aware, not perfect)
- Ethics: 4 (secondary for viral)
- Autonomy: 5 (acceptable for fun content)
- Momentum: 15 (drive engagement/shares)
- Resonance: 10 (platform-native, trendy)

**Validation**: Sum = 100 ✓
**Synergies**: Authenticity (20) + Empathy (15) + Resonance (10) = strong social signals
**Assessment**: ✓ Valid for viral/social

---

## Common Validation Errors & Fixes

| Error | Why Invalid | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Sum = 101 | Math doesn't work | Reduce any dimension by 1 |
| Presence: 110 | Out of range | Cap at 100 max |
| Presence: -5 | Negative values | Minimum is 0 |
| All dimensions = 11 (99 total) | Forgot to distribute | Add 1 to any dimension |

---

## When to Use High vs Low Values

| Situation | Use High (70+) | Use Low (0-30) |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Presence** | Short-form video, impulse buys, crowded feed | Long-form content, calm/premium |
| **Authenticity** | Social proof needed, UGC strategy | Premium/luxury, polished brand |
| **Trust** | New brand, high-ticket, unknown | Established brand, low-ticket |
| **Empathy** | Problem-solution narrative, DTC | B2B, abstract products |
| **Taste** | Luxury, premium, aspirational | Discount/volume, budget |
| **Ethics** | Values-conscious audience, sustainability | Commodity products, indifferent audience |
| **Autonomy** | B2B, consultative, long sales cycle | Impulse, flash sales, limited time |
| **Momentum** | DTC, conversions, time-limited | Brand awareness, relationship building |
| **Resonance** | Social media, viral potential | Long-form, evergreen, timeless |

---

## Questions to Ask When Validating
